        <p> A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” 
            (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper 
            is a paragraph.
            For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.</p>
